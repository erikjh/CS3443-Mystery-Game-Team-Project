# CS3443-Mystery-Game-Team-Project

here's the original character dialogue/prop dialogue I wrote for the game.
Character/ Room Placement
Bedroom One: Judy
Bedroom Two: William & Junie (Murderer)
Kitchen: Samson & Jason (crazy eyes)
Home Entrance: Murder Victim (Michelle) 



Note: I have decided she's a crazy cat lady… I will be adding cats to the game…
***I think having this could be funny…***
Michelle’s Initial Click Dialogue: “…”
Michelle’s Second Click Dialogue: “…need I say more…”
Michelle’s Third Click Dialogue: “…why are you proding a dead woman…”
Michelle’s Fourth+ Click Dialogue: “…the dead can’t speak…let her rest in peace…”



(Note: we should probably have a like (1 / 2 )next to the character dialogue so the player knows how many times to click the character)
Initial Click on Character

Judy: (1 / 2) Where was I when the shot went off? I was taking a nap here in this room. I’m a heavy sleeper.
	(2/2) Of course I slept through the noise, we’re out in the country-side! Guns go off all the time! Ever heard of hunting??”

William: That’s a bit of a personal question…well we were in here… I’d rather not go into detail if you’re catching what I’m throwing.

Junie: I was here with my husband, that's all you need to know.

Samson: *looks over at Jason* well I was here in the kitchen getting a snack…

Jason: *glares at Samson* we were both here in the kitchen around that time, I came in while he *glares at Samson* was poking his nose around here…


Home Entrance Items
Suicide Note: I CAN’T TAKE THIS ANYMORE! THIS HOUSE, MY JOB, THIS LIFE IT’S TOO MUCH STRESS TO BARE! THE NOVELS I DREAMED OF WRITING…I WANTED TO BE A NY BESTSELLING AUTHOR…now…well it’s not like I ever would have made it…fairwell cruel world…

Gun: You notice the bullet exit wound is on her forehead…it would've been pretty difficult for her to shoot herself from behind.

Blood Splatter: You notice the blood splatter direction doesn’t align with the way Michelle’s body is laying…you should dig deeper into this…


Home Entrance Item Character Dialogue
(Note this dialogue will not populate unless the player has clicked all of the Home entrance items)

Judy: (1 / 2) “I don’t know what my granddaughter had to complain about, we all have hard lives…she was just weak-minded, I don’t know why my husband gave her this house, it should’ve gone to me.”
(2/2) “You want me to write a note for you…if it won’t take up too much of my time…this is an odd request…”

Judy: “I never was a fan of her work…but to go this far over a few failed books…like I said, she was a weak-minded child.”

William: (1 / 2) “So she killed herself…poor kid, I used to read my niece stories when she was young…I like to think I inspired her to be an author…to think the stress of it all is what killed her..”
(2/2) “of course I can write this note for ya…it pains me to write these words, but I’ll do it for her…”

Junie: “Sure I’ll write you a note my husband cherished his niece. It’s a shame the house isn’t going to him, he inspired her to become an author. Have you seen her godfather? He’s not all there.”

Junie’s Note:I CAN’T TAKE THIS ANYMORE! THIS HOUSE, MY JOB, THIS LIFE IT’S TOO MUCH STRESS TO BARE! THE NOVELS I DREAMED OF WRITING…I WANTED TO BE A NY BESTSELLING AUTHOR…now…well it’s not like I ever would have made it…fairwell cruel world…

	Fake Will Note: “If your reading this I have past. Since I love my godfather so much I am leaving my home, my cats…all to him, Jason Smith. I know he will be their for my baby’s.”

END GAME NOTES:

***I’m thinking for end game they type in who they think the killer is, allow this option only after all items and character dialogue has been found/introduced…if they type in the wrong name they get a “You sent an innocent to prison…GAME OVER”***

***If they get it correct “YOU FOUND THE MURDERER! Now Michelle can rest in peace.”***

***Also if they get it wrong they have to restart the game, the decision on who they make go to jail is permanent…if you catch my drift***
